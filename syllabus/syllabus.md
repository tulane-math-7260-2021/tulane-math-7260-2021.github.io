# Math 6040/7260 - Linear Models - Spring 2021

## Syllabus

### Course Topics

The term “linear models” describes a wide class of methods for the statistical analysis of multivariate data. The underlying theory is grounded in linear algebra and multivariate statistics, but applications range from biological research to public policy. The objective of this course is to provide a solid introduction to both the theory and practice of linear models, combining mathematical concepts with realistic examples.

### Prerequisite

An undergraduate courses in statistics and probability.  Some computer programming experience and familiarity with genetics terms is highly recommended.  For those looking for a probability refresher, I suggest _Introduction to Probability Models_ by Sheldon Ross.

### Course Texts

The main text for this course is _Computational Molecular Evolution_ by Yang.
A supplementary book, _Analysis of Phylogenetics and Evolution in R_ by Paradis,
is more hands-on. Also highly recommended are _Inferring Phylogenies_ by Felnsenstein and
_Statistical Methods in Molecular Evolution_ edited by Nielsen.  _Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models of Protein and Nucleic Acids_ by Durbin, Eddy, Krogh and Mitchison provides a sound introduction to tree reconstruction.  Two books with practical examples of how to use current phylogenetic software are _The Phylogenetic Handbook: A Practical Approach to DNA and Protein Phylogeny_ edited by Lemey and Vandamme and _Phylogenetic Trees Made Easy_ by Hall.  For those more mathematically inclined, try _Mathematics of Evolution & Phylogeny_ edited by Gascuel and _Gene Genealogies, Variation and Evolution: A Primer in Coalescent Theory_ by Hein, Schierup and Wuif.

### Computing

Many homework problems and all (unless highly theoretical) final projects will require phylogenetic computation.  I have reserved the Biomath computer lab on Wednesdays for sporadic in-class data analysis examples and time for students to familiarize themselves with several existing phylogenetic programs.  Free packages include:

- [Geneious](http://www.geneious.com) -- convenient framework for analyzing molecular sequence data, excellent user-interface and plugins to run most evolutionary biology (Biomatters)
- [PHYLIP](http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html) -- large collection of different parsimony-, distance- and likelihood-based programs (Felsenstein)
- [PAML](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html) -- likelihood- and empirical Bayes-based nucleotide and codon programs (Yang)
- [MrBayes](http://mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu/index.php) -- Bayesian sampler for standard continuous-time Markov chain models (Ronquist, Huelsenbeck, Larget, Simon, Suchard)
- [BEAST](http://beast.community) -- Bayesian sampler for coalescent models (Drummond, Rambaut, Suchard)
- [BAli-Phy](http://www.biomath.ucla.edu/msuchard/bali-phy/) -- Bayesian sampler for joint estimation of alignment and phylogeny (Redelings, Suchard)
- [SPREAD](https://github.com/phylogeography/SpreaD3) -- Spatial phylogenetic reconstruction of evolutionary dynamics (Bielejec, Baele, Rambaut, Suchard, Lemey)
- [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) -- flexible tree drawing program (Rambaut)

### Practicals

Note that [http://beast.community](http://beast.community) serves up many tutorials that we may use in this course, each with molecular epidemiology of infectious disease examples and [Joe Felsenstein](http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/book/datasets.html) provides all datasets used in _Inferring Phylogenies_.

### Grading

Grades will be based on the homework (50%) and final phylogenetic analysis project (50%).

### Data Analysis Project

You are expected to perform an original phylogenetic data analysis project during this course and present your model developments or findings in a mini-seminar series (approximately 15-20 mins per student) during Finals week.
Additionally, a written report of your work (max. 10 typed pages) is due on
3/19 by 5PM via email (PDF).  You are responsible for finding an appropriate data set and designing your study. One page project proposals
are due
2/19 by 5PM via email (PDF).  You should plan on attending several Biostatistics (Wednesdays at 3:30PM) and Human Genetics (Mondays at 11:00AM) department seminars to get a feeling for the appropriate format.

### Attendance

I usually expect class attendance. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, I understand students may not be able to attend certain lectures due to medical or technical reasons. Please proactively communicate with me about your circumstances at earliest chance.

### Inclusivity

UCLA’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion provides resources, events, and information about current initiatives at UCLA to support equality for all members of the UCLA community. I hope that you will communicate with me or your TA if you experience anything in this course that does not support an inclusive environment, and you can also report any incidents you may witness or experience on campus to the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion on their website <https://equity.ucla.edu>.


### Academic Integrity

**Message about Academic Integrity to All UCLA Students from UCLA Dean of Students**: UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, all members including faculty staff and students alike are responsible for maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a student and member of the University community, you are here to get an education and are, therefore, expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic endeavors. You are evaluated on your own merits. Cheating, plagiarism, collaborative work, multiple submissions without the permission of the professor, or other kinds of academic dishonesty are considered unacceptable behavior and will result in formal disciplinary proceedings usually resulting in suspension or dismissal.

**Forms of Academic Dishonesty**: As specified in the UCLA Student Conduct Code, violations or attempted violations of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, multiple submissions or facilitating academic integrity:
• Allowing another person to take a quiz, exam, or similar evalution for you
• Using unauthorized material, information, or study aids in any academic exercise or examination – textbook, notes, formula list, calculators, etc.
• Unauthorized collaboration in providing or requesting assistance, such as sharing information
• Unauthorized use of someone else’s data in completing a computer exercise
• Altering a graded exam or assignment and requesting that I be regraded

**Plagiarism**: Presenting another’s words or ideas as if they were one’s own
• Submitting as your own through purchase or otherwise, part of or an entire work produced verbatim by someone else
• Paraphrasing ideas, data or writing without properly acknowledging the source
• Unauthorized transfer and use of someone else’s computer file as your own
• Unauthorized use of someone else’s data in completing a computer exercise

**Multiple Submissions**: Submitting the same work (with exact or similar content) in more than one class without permission from the instructor to do so. This includes courses you are currently taking, as well as courses you might take in another quarter.

**Facilitating Academic Dishonesty**: Participating in any action that compromises the integrity of the academic standards of the University; assisting another to commit an act of academic dishonesty
• Taking a quiz, exam, or similar evaluation in place of another person
• Allowing another student to copy from you
• Providing material or other information to another student with knowledge that such assistance could be used in any of the violations stated above (e.g., giving test information to students in other discussion sections of the same course)
• Altering data to support research
• Presenting results from research that was not performed
• Crediting source material that was not used for  research

While you are here at UCLA, if you are unsure whether what you are considering doing is cheating, **don’t take chances** – ask your professor. In addition, avoid placing yourself in situations which might lead your professor to **suspect you of cheating**.

**Alternatives to Academic Dishonesty**

• Seek out help – Meet with your professor, ask for assistance as needed.
• Ask for an extension – if you explain your situation to your professor, she/he might be able to grant you an extended deadline for an upcoming assignment.
•	See a counselor at Student Psychological Services, and/or your school, college or department – UCLA has many resources for students who are feeling the stresses of academic and personal pressures.
